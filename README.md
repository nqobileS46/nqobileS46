what is morse code:

Morse code is a telecommunications method which encodes text characters as standardized sequences of two signal durations, called dots and dashes. It was named after Samuel Morse
each morse code symbol is formed in dits and dahs(the other name for dots and dashes that is used in morse code)
The dit duration can vary for signal clarity and operator skill, but for any one message, once the rhythm is established, a half-beat is the basic unit of time measurement in Morse code
Morse code was originally designed so that the duration of each symbol is approximately inverse to the frequency of occurrence of the character that it represents in text of the English language
The are two and they're systems are similar, but the International Morse Code is simpler and more precise. The original Morse Code used patterns of dots and spaces to represent a few of the letters
but with International Morse it uses combinations of dots and short dashes for all letters.International Morse Code they use dashes than variable lengths used in the original Morse Code.
morse code was invented to communicate the English language through electric pulse signals via the telegraph. 
It allowed the translation of combinations of short and long electric pulses into letters and words. Morse code made instant long-distance communication possible.
it was created in the 1830s and in 1840s he was working with Alfred
Morse code is based on a binary system, where each character is composed of a combination of two elements:
                                                                                                     *a dot (.)
                                                                                                     *and a dash (-).
A dot is the shortest element also called a dit, and it lasts for one unit of time. A dash is the longer element, also called dah, and it lasts for three units of time
wires were strung in United State for people to communicate and get messages as soon as possible

THE HISTORY CONTEXT OF MORSE CODE:

The invention of Morse code was motivated by the growing demand for rapid communication over long distances, particularly in the context of expanding railroads, shipping routes, and other forms of transportation.
Before the advent of Morse code, communication over long distances was limited to methods such as semaphore flags or visual signals, which were slow and prone to errors.
Morse code revolutionized communication by enabling messages to be transmitted almost instantaneously over telegraph lines.
Its adoption facilitated the growth of telegraph networks worldwide and played a crucial role in connecting people and businesses across vast distances.
As a result, Morse code became an indispensable tool in telecommunication and laid the groundwork for modern forms of long-distance communication.
